## Project Summary

### Project Objectives
- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.
- Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make your process repeateable.
- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques.
- Deliver a 5 minute presentation consisting of a high-level notebook walkthrough using your Jupyter Notebook from above; your presentation should be appropriate for your target audience.
- Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

### Business Goals
- Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

### Audience
- Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is the Codeup Data Science team. 

### Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook Report 
- README.md file containing the project information
- CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn
- Acquire and prepare files
- Notebook walkthrough presentation 

### Project Specifications
- Why are our customers churning?
